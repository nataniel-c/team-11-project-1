# Vibeify

## Description: 
This code creates a web application where the user can type in the web address for an image and get a song from Spotify matching the feeling or "vibe" of the image. The project uses Microsoft Vision API to describe the image, openAI API to generate a song name, and Spotify API to display the embed and play a song. Also local storage is used to store the image and song name that was generated in the first page into the second page

## Installation
